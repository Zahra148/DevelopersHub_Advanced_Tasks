Machine Learning Definition

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to automatically learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming.

Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled datasets where input-output pairs are provided. The model learns to map inputs to correct outputs.

Common supervised learning algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.

Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The goal is to discover hidden structures or patterns.

Clustering algorithms like K-Means group similar data points, while dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA reduce feature complexity.

Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment and learning through rewards and penalties.

The agent aims to maximize cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning is used in robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems.

Key Machine Learning Concepts

Training data is used to teach the model.

Testing data evaluates model performance on unseen examples.

Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.

Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture underlying patterns.

Model Evaluation Metrics

Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Machine Learning Lifecycle

The lifecycle includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation Definition

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that combines information retrieval with language generation to produce factually grounded responses.

Why RAG Is Needed

Large Language Models may hallucinate or provide outdated information.

RAG mitigates this by retrieving relevant documents before generating answers.

RAG System Workflow

A user submits a query.

The query is converted into an embedding vector.

The embedding is compared against stored document vectors.

The most relevant documents are retrieved using similarity search.

The retrieved documents are provided as context to the language model.

The model generates a response grounded in retrieved information.

Core Components of a RAG System

Document Loader loads raw data from files or databases.

Text Splitter divides documents into smaller chunks.

Embedding Model converts text into numerical vectors.

Vector Database stores embeddings for similarity search.

Retriever fetches relevant chunks.

Language Model generates final answers.

Vector Databases in RAG

Vector databases enable efficient similarity search using embeddings.

They store vectors along with metadata.

Examples include Qdrant, Pinecone, and Weaviate.

Context Memory in Conversational RAG

Context memory stores previous user and assistant messages.

This allows follow-up questions to be answered correctly.

Conversation memory improves coherence and user experience.

Benefits of RAG Systems

RAG systems reduce hallucinations.

They provide traceable knowledge sources.

They allow updating knowledge without retraining the model.

They scale efficiently with large document collections.

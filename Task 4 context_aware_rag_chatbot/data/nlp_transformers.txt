Natural Language Processing Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

Core NLP Tasks

Text classification assigns predefined labels to text.

Sentiment analysis determines emotional tone.

Named Entity Recognition identifies names, locations, and organizations.

Machine translation converts text from one language to another.

Question answering retrieves or generates answers from text.

Limitations of Traditional NLP Models

Earlier NLP models relied on rule-based systems and statistical methods that struggled with context and long dependencies.

Transformer Architecture

Transformers are deep learning models based on self-attention mechanisms that process entire sequences simultaneously.

Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence relative to each other.

Advantages of Transformers

Transformers handle long-range dependencies better than recurrent models.

They enable parallel computation, improving training efficiency.

They produce contextual embeddings where word meaning depends on surrounding words.

Popular Transformer Models

BERT focuses on understanding text.

GPT focuses on text generation.

T5 treats NLP tasks as text-to-text problems.

Applications of Transformers

Transformers power chatbots, virtual assistants, search engines, code generation tools, and content creation systems.
